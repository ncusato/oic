# Invoke queries on Oracle Blockchain Platform (OBP) using Oracle Integrator Cloud (OIC)

## Introduction

This workshop is to educate customers on how to invoke queries on Oracle Blockchain Platform (OBP) using an App Driven Integration on Oracle Integrator Cloud (OIC). One of the main methods of invoking the blockchain on OBP is through an API. This lab deploys a sample chaincode (BalanceTransfer) on OBP.
